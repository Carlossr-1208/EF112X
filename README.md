Abstract
Water monitoring is an essential process that manages
the well-being of freshwater ecosystems. However, it is
generally an inefficient process as most data collection is done
manually. By combining wireless sensor technology and machine
learning techniques, projects such as iWater aim to modernize
current methods. The purpose of the iWater project is to develop
a network of smart sensors capable of collecting and analyzing
water quality-related data in real time.
To contribute to this goal, a comparative study between the
performance of a centralized machine learning algorithm that
is currently used, and a distributed model based on a federated
learning algorithm was done. The data used for training and
testing both models was collected by a wireless sensor developed
by the iWater project. The centralized algorithm was used as
the basis for the developed distributed model. Due to lack of
sensors, the distributed model was simulated by down-sampling
and dividing the sensor data into six data sets representing an
individual sensor. The results are similar for both models and
the developed algorithm reaches an accuracy of 98.41 %.
